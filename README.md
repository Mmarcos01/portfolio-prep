[x] Your professional pitch:   
My name is Marie Marcos and I'm a Software Developer from Washington State. 

I previously served in the Navy as an aviation electrician where I made a lot of memories and learned a lot of lessons- some good, some not so much- but all were valuable.

My decision to leave the military was not an easy one, but I always had it in my heart to continue my education- and thats what i did- a few years after the Navy, I earned my degree in design.

I pursued design because I love stories, and I enjoy making things- from music and art- to toys for my nieces and nephews. If I can think it up and make it real, it just feels awesome- especially when someone else can enjoy it too

Now my next question to myself was how can I share my passion and make a career out of it? 

Well after learning to code- I discovered that the answer was Software Development- in tech, I get to collaborate creatively and use my technical skills to do what I love- take an idea- and make it a reality.
